                </div>
                    <p>Practicing psychology is one of my greatest pleasures and most fulfilling pursuits. I would like to share how my career started and the theoretical foundations of my work. </p>

<p>Determining one’s career path usually involves starting out on a completely different road.  I chose the path that excited me, I excelled in and last, the one that feels most “home” to me.  That describes my career journey.   While I was in my nursing school, I much preferred the therapeutic conversations that I had with my patients over the direct medical care that I administered.  After much anxiety I changed my major and did my research.  I decided that I would  pursue a doctorate in psychology.  My dream was to develop a treatment program in which many people’s lives would be equipped with positive practical and meaningful coping skills that would allow them to live at their highest potential.  It would be based on strengths as opposed to weaknesses. 

<p>More than thirty years have passed since this dream began.  You may wonder, to what extent does reality mirror my dream?   The answer is partly.  The vision I had for my future contributed only partly to  the forces that actually shaped my career and my life.  The older you are, the more you humbly realize the truth of this.  I am immeasurably grateful for my career.  I enjoyed a thriving practice in which other mental health providers and I served large numbers of people in the Tampa Bay area..  I have reached thousands of people with meaningful information about emotional, social, and spiritual health on the radio.  I currently have the privilege of serving Veterans at Bay Pines VA Health Care System.  I also train VA employees to be more effective health coaches and to connect better with each other and with Veterans. </p>

<p>My small private practice is like coming home. I develop close relationships with my patients and utilize my experience, skills, knowledge and evidence based treatments to promote meaningful psychological and social healing. My patients are able to receive individualized care because I maintain a small practice which allows me to devote my very best to them. </p>

<p>My psychotherapy practice is informed by an ever-growing body of literature that I continually refer to.  A variety of therapeutic approaches form the foundation of my work.  These include cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, exposure response prevention, meditation/mindfulness, solution-focused therapy, and  systems theories, and imago therapy.  The art/science of psychotherapy calls for the practitioner to select the most relevant approach that will have the greatest positive impact on ones’ patient(s). The most important factor associated with success however is the trusting relationship between the therapist and the patient.</p>
