                    <p>Practicing psychology is one of my greatest pleasures and most fulfilling pursuits. I would like to share how my career started and the theoretical foundations of my work. </p>

<p>Determining one’s career path usually involves starting out on a completely different road.  I chose the path that excited me, I excelled in and last, the one that feels most “home” to me.  That describes my career journey.   While I was in my nursing school, I much preferred the therapeutic conversations that I had with my patients over the direct medical care that I administered.  After much anxiety I changed my major and did my research.  I decided that I would  pursue a doctorate in psychology.  My dream was to develop a treatment program in which many people’s lives would be equipped with positive practical and meaningful coping skills that would allow them to live at their highest potential.  It would be based on strengths as opposed to weaknesses. 

<p>More than thirty years have passed since this dream began.  You may wonder, to what extent does reality mirror my dream?   The answer is partly.  The vision I had for my future contributed only partly to  the forces that actually shaped my career and my life.  The older you are, the more you humbly realize the truth of this.  I am immeasurably grateful for my career.  I enjoyed a thriving practice in which other mental health providers and I served large numbers of people in the Tampa Bay area..  I have reached thousands of people with meaningful information about emotional, social, and spiritual health on the radio.  I currently have the privilege of serving Veterans at Bay Pines VA Health Care System.  I also train VA employees to be more effective health coaches and to connect better with each other and with Veterans. </p>

<p>My small private practice is like coming home. I develop close relationships with my patients and utilize my experience, skills, knowledge and evidence based treatments to promote meaningful psychological and social healing. My patients are able to receive individualized care because I maintain a small practice which allows me to devote my very best to them. </p>

<p>My psychotherapy practice is informed by an ever-growing body of literature that I continually refer to.  A variety of therapeutic approaches form the foundation of my work.  These include cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, exposure response prevention, meditation/mindfulness, solution-focused therapy, and  systems theories, and imago therapy.  The art/science of psychotherapy calls for the practitioner to select the most relevant approach that will have the greatest positive impact on ones’ patient(s). The most important factor associated with success however is the trusting relationship between the therapist and the patient.</p>

                    <h3>CBT</h3>
                    <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most widely used and researched evidence based practice for treating psychological issues.  CBT focuses on developing personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing  thoughts, beliefs and attitudes.  It is problem focused, action-oriented. A basic principle of CBT is that thought distortions and maladaptive behaviors contribute to mental health problems and by identifying and replacing these distortions, one is able to reduce symptoms and associated distress.

                    <h3>Exposure Response Prevention</h3>
                    <p>Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a treatment method for a variety of anxiety disorders, especially obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias. The method is based on the idea that anxiety symptoms are reduced when individuals confront their fears and discontinue their escape response. An example: A person repeatedly washes her hands, believing that she has contaminated herself with with germs, after touching a doorknob. The person is exposed to their feared stimulus (touching a doorknob), and refuses to respond with any cleaning behavior. Exposure therapy for a  phobia calls for the refraining from the escape response at all times. Individuals experience habituation (a decrease/cease of responding to a feared stimulus (e.g. elevator) after repeated presentations) and also practice a fear-incompatible behavioral response he/she is exposed to the feared stimulus. Even though these strategies cause short-term anxiety, it results in a long-term reduction in obsessive and compulsive symptoms.</p>

                    <h3>Psychodynamic Psychotherapy</h3>
                    <p>The primary focus of this therapy is to reveal the unconscious material of our lives which negatively impact daily life. It is a more traditional, insight-oriented form of treatment which connects the origin of emotional distress of childhood family experiences to today’s experiences, attitudes, feelings and behaviors.  The therapist helps the client to process these insights within a supportive therapeutic relationship, by putting words to feelings, and by interpreting the causes of negative emotions.</p>

                    <h3>Meditation / Mindfulness</h3>
                    <p> This ancient practice of calming the mind and body by focusing attention on one thing (e.g. breath, image, movement) and being fully in the present moment offers one of the healthiest canvas upon which to paint a healthy inner peace and awareness.  People from all walks of life and beliefs are able to experience the well researched benefits of meditation.  Stress management, pain management, substance abuse recovery, improvement in sleep, and even blood glucose levels result from a daily practice of meditation.

                    <h3>Solutions Focused Therapy</h3>
                    <p>Solution Focused Therapy is a goal-directed collaborative approach that involves direct observation of patient’s responses to a series of questions  that assess what patients want to achieve by exploring the history and origin of problem(s). Nevertheless, the majority of SF therapy sessions typically focus on the present and future.

                    <p>Couples therapy is a challenging, but rewarding form of treatment. Imago therapy gives couples information and tools to make unconscious aspects of their relationship conscious, resolve conflict, meet each other’s needs, heal, and create emotional safety with each other.

                    <h3>Family Systems Therapy</h3>
                    <p>This  goal of this approach is to gain insight into each member’s role as it relates to the healthy functionality of the whole family. Every family member is connected to each other through a system of relationships that can be identified  and observed by the therapist and family members. Participants are asked to demonstrate the roles they play in normal family life. Once these are recognized, family members begin to understand how their actions affect each other and adopt positive behaviors that benefit themselves and the family as a whole.
